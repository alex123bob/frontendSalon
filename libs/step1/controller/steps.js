                                The $digest call is done in a finally block to \
                                make sure the digest will happen even if the function throws an exception.<br />\
                                The big idea of $apply is that we can execute some code that isn\'t aware of Angular. \
                                That code may still change things on the scope, \
                                and $apply makes sure that any watches on the scope will pick up on those changes. \
                                When people talk about integrating code to the "Angular lifecycle" using $apply, \
                                this is essentially what they mean. There really isn\'t much more to it than that.',

                                But there\'s a lot more to Angular scopes than this, such as $evalAsync, scopePhases, \
                                $$postDigest and exceptionHandler etc.<br /><br /> \
                                Perhaps most significantly, scopes in Angular are not always standalone, \
                                disconnected objects. Instead, scopes can inherit from other scopes, \
                                and watches can watch things not only on the scope they are attached to, \
                                but also on that scope\'s parents. This approach, while conceptually quite simple, \
                                is often a source of much confusion to newcomers.<br /><br /> \
                                Here I\'d like to recommend you a book called "Know Your AngularJS Inside Out", which is\
                                available on eBook now. In this book it will create your own implementation of AngularJS\
                                piece by piece. Then you will thoroughly know how this framework ticks.',
